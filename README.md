## Software Architect, Ruby on Rails
#### _Rockridge Solutions_

The best fit for Todd is a project looking for an architect to help build out a new solution, or conversely, someone to help rescue a code base that has gone astray. _Who doesn't love a greenfield project?_ A clean slate means you can pick the best-fitting framework and implement best practices; however, poor choices here can have long-term consequences. 

Todd's long history of product development—for software companies, internal business applications, and consumer websites—helps him find the right balance between short-term and long-term requirements and put in place practices that will help guide the project for its full lifecycle.

All too often applications find themselves collapsing under the weight of too many shortcuts and too many poor decisions. Estimates for small features get longer and longer. Neither the development team nor the business is happy with the pace. Todd's written enough bad code to know what good code looks like (sadly, that is the path). He can help you refactor your code base to eliminate tightly coupled code and redundant code that weigh down each successive feature.

### Experience

Todd has been designing and building Ruby on Rails applications since 2013. Prior to that he helped clients implement and customize ERP software. In over 20 years of software development experience, Todd had built strong object oriented design skills. His prior life as an ERP developer also gives him strong SQL skills.

Examples of his work can be found in the following open source projects. Each gem provides solutions to common problems in Rails applications:
- [Filterameter](https://github.com/RockSolt/): Declarative Filter Parameters for Rails Controllers
- [Next Page](https://github.com/RockSolt/next_page): Pagination for Rails Controllers
- [Run Time Settings](https://github.com/RockSolt/run_time_settings): Persistent, run-time application settings
